# Front-end Nanodegree Project #5

#### Resturant Reviews App

## Project Overview:

Given a static design that lacks accessibility, convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. You will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

#### Notes:

You have been provided the code for a restaurant reviews website. The code has a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. Your job is to update the code to resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality. 

## Dependencies
- Font Awesome
- Google Fonts (Quicksand 300, 500, 700)
- Google Maps API

## How to Use

Fork this respository, then clone it to your local machine. Create a simple HTTP server using Python. _Note: You do not need to know Python for this._  Check your Python version before starting by running `python -V` from the terminal.

#### If using Python 2
- spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000`

#### If using Python 3
- spin up the server with `python3 -m http.server 8000`

Once the server is up and running, navigate to `localhost:8000` to see the app in action!
